This website is for Encounter Ministries, a weekly student-run worship in Henderson, TN.  This is a relatively new group whose mission is to help people encounter Jesus in an authentic way. Since I was so excited for them, I wanted to give them a tool to reach out to even more people and reach this goal. 

The minister introduced me to Justin Hoover is a graphic designer, artist, and Encounter veteran. He created all the logos. The color scheme is taken from the church that supports them: Skyline Church of Christ. I am pleased with the finished product except for a couple of kinks with the alignment that I plan on sorting out next week.
